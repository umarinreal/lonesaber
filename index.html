                <div><p id="mercury">Mercury pollution is a major environmental issue and has spread all over the world. Mercury exposure can last for several decades and even centuries. Methyl mercury, a bio accumulative form of mercury, can affect both humans and wildlife. Human activities such as deforestation, wetland destruction, industrialization, urbanization, and climate change contribute to mercury release in the environment. In Japan, mercury pollution has disrupted the food chain, particularly seafood and fish, due to 82 tons of mercury released into Minamata Bay by the Gizo Corporation. This has become a social issue, and the Minamata Convention was created to protect human health and the environment. Reduction of anthropogenic emissions of mercury is crucial to achieving social development goals for water and sanitation. Mercury pollution is caused by silver, gold and mercury mining, coal burning, metallurgy chemical manufacturing, and microbial methylations and biomagnifications. Volcanic eruptions, global anthropogenic emissions, and naturally occurring degassing also contribute to mercury emissions. Mercury toxicity rate, dosage, and exposure determine its health impacts on humans. The brain is highly affected by mercury vapor, while gut linings and kidneys are also vulnerable to mercury and mercury salts. Neurological damage is a common health issue caused by mercury exposure. Urgent actions are necessary, and alternative energy sources should be used instead of burning coal or using mercury.</p></div>

                <div><p id="mercury">China has experienced rapid economic growth and modern urbanization in the past 30 years, leading to a dramatic increase in energy consumption. However, this has also resulted in high levels of air pollution. In fact, China is considered one of the most air-polluted countries worldwide, according to the United Nations in 2022. Globally, air pollution is the greatest environmental risk to public health. Air pollution was the cause of one in nine deaths worldwide in 2019, according to the World Health Organization.
                    A study conducted by Zao et al. in 2022 found that since the Industrial Revolution, photochemical smog and soot pollution have increased, consequently causing a greenhouse effect by destroying the global ozone layer. Air pollution is made up of many solid particles and gases, with the deadliest particle being known as particulate matter (PM) 2.5. PM 2.5 is only 2.5 microns in diameter and causes premature mortality, cancer, lung disease, and respiratory diseases. These inhalable particles are smaller and more easily transported than coarser air pollutants, diffusing deeper into the lungs and increasing toxicity for humans.
                    China's large coal burning industry significantly increases the presence of air pollutants, and China's PM 2.5 air quality was measured by the UN at a concentration of 48 micrograms per cubic meter annually in 2021, which is 9.6 times more than the WHO guideline of 5 globally. Respiratory diseases are the most common cause of mortality and morbidity in children, who are more susceptible to the health effects of air pollution due to their smaller airways, higher ventilation rates, and developing lung systems.
                    Several studies have investigated respiratory outcomes of children in China, confirming that early exposure to ambient air pollution affects the lung development of children. Respiratory diseases account for 25.7% of all child hospitalizations in China. In 2018, Bay et al. found that nearly 500,000 newborns died of air pollution within their first month of life. The Chinese government has released strict air pollution control and action plans, though challenges remain. A study by Zao et al. in 2022 found that the implementation of green management is crucial to reducing environmental pollution while maintaining economic development in China.
                    Further research on air pollution and human health, the formulation of relevant policies, and investigating technological innovation to eliminate air pollution is crucial. We need to conserve what our children deserve and stop polluting the air before it stops them from breathing.
